## Work for final day on Boundless Avocado: ##

* Presentation
  * Steve Jobs style: Guacamole Computers Company
    Thank you for being here. We're very excited to share what we've been working on.
    We have three products to share with you today:
      1. A web client to remember what you're interested in.
      2. An easier way to text all of your friends, exactly when you want to join them.
      3. A way to stay connecting with various groups of friends, without setting up a mailing list server.
    One more thing, they're all the same.
    Let me introduce you to GuacFriends.
